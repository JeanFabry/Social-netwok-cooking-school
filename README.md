## What is this ?
It is a work as part of our training at **[BeCode](https://becode.org)**. <br>

The MyBocus site is a platform for Bocus Academy apprentices and chefs. 
It allows apprentices to notify that they are present. 
They can also enter recipes to be presented during their course. <br/>
They also have a private member area with their personal information. <br/>


## Context  
This group project is a consolidation project, meant to make us work both our frontend skills & what we learned so far about backend (PHP) and databases (mySQL).<br/>
We divided the work into two groups. A front team, a backend team.
We used a trello to keep each other informed of each other's progress and held briefings 3 times a day.<br/>
Of course, the chef of the academy have a different interface (they are chef :wink: )
